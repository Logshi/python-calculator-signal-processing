# Python Calculator and Signal Processing App

This project is a basic Python application that functions as a calculator and a signal processing tool. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and also allows users to generate sine waves and perform Fourier transforms.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Sine wave generation with user-defined parameters (frequency, amplitude)
- Summation of multiple sine waves
- Fourier Transform visualization
- Option to save the generated graphs as `.png` files
